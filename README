                          Window Maker Dockapp for MPD

A little app in the style of wmusic and wmapmload/wmcpuload. It represents a fairly complete interface to MPD.

My thanks to Thomas Nemeth who came up with the LCD type design and Hades <hadess@hadess.net>
who wrote xmusic which provided the inspiration for this.

I can make no guarantee about this codes functionality on systems other than Linux - I do not
have other OSes to test upon (least ways ones that I regularly boot into).
